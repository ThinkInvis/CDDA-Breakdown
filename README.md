# Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

"Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have..."

## The Breakdown

Cataclysm: Breakdown is a "mod" of C:DDA created by ThinkInvisible for personal use. In C:BD, more than just zombies have invaded the world... entire laws of physics have changed!
C:BD adds many various changes to C:DDA, ones that don't fit the design plan of the original -- such as magic. This is NOT an excessively public project, and pull requests by other users are not likely to be accepted.
There's a [LOCAL BRAINSTORMING FILE](../brainstorm.md) for a good list of planned changes.
